## Digital Art

I think there is some future to NFTs

The Realist Perspective (blah, blah, blah):

Blockchain technology is here to stay... at the underlying facet of it all, blockchain is currently the most secure way for people to ensure trust. The chain contains within it history. Contracts and a transparent ledger allows for a degree of openness not inherent in current monetary systems.

The Artist Perspective:

The chain is a living entity in and of itself. As humanity spread across the stars, it'll take the blockchain with it. Art printed today will forever be in the history of humanity. Curious to know, if this knowledge should set the 'Artist' free.
